# FM.GeoLocation.Web

A web front-end that exposes the FM.GeoLocation functionality.

I need something to keep me sane during this Covid-19 craziness. The plan is to create a simple front end to the service that have the following features:

* Lookup a IP or domain and view the location on a map
* Provide a list of domains/IPs and view all the locations on a map
* Provide a tracert output that is parsed and the hops are displayed on a map
* Potentially other 'network' features such as running a tracert from the web app, DNS lookups etc.
